Implement structure Vector3D that represents vector in R^3 euclidean space.

Stage 1 (2 Pts):
    Create constructor that takes three double parameters x, y, z.
    Vector stores coefficients as three double fields (YOU CANNOT CHANGE THEM).
    Create X, Y, Z properties that return/modify corresponding coefficients.
    Create Equals method that compares two vectors using element-wise operations.
        Do not forget to implement other (required by Equals) methods.
    Create ToString method that returns string in form of "Vector3D(X = x, Y = y, Z = z)".

Stage 2 (1 Pts):
    Vector3D should contain five static fields that return following values:
        Zero - Vector with three coefficients equal to zero.
        One - Vector with three coefficients equal to one.
        UnitX, UnitY, UnitZ - Corresponding unit vectors.
    Create Length properties that returns length of a vector (in euclidean metrics).
    Create Dot (static and instanced/normal version) method that returns dot product of a vector.

Stage 3 (1 Pts):
    Create tuple decomposition method that returns tuple with three double elements x,y,z.
    Create implicit converter that returns Vector3D from three double elements tuple.
    Create indexer that allows user to get existing and assign new values to vector.
        It should throw IndexOutOfRangeException exception for indices out of [0-2] range.

Stage 4 (1 Pts):
    Create Normalize method that normalizes the vector (does nothing for zero-vector).
    Create Normalized method that returns normalized copy of a vector (returns zero-vector for zero-vector).
    Create MakeUnit method that returns normalized vector of the one given by parameters.
    Create AlmostEquals method that checks whether two vectors (this and one given by parameter) are almost equal (element-wise distance).
        Method is having an epsilon parameter (with default value of 1e-7) that describes the tolerance (of almost word).
    Create IsNaN (instanced/normal version) that checks whether any coefficient is not a number.
