In this task we will pretend that we're writing program for displaying animations.
It will read frames from disk and display them in correct order with synchronization.

After creating project ensure you are using c++17 - if not some things may not work.
Then compile project and copy "dataset" directory where your project is located.
DO NOT edit files in "dataset" directory nor even open them - if you accidentally
modify one of it you can have different results and waste time debugging that.

That lab isn't typical - its purpose is to show you a bit of modern C++.
In (almost) every phase there are links to cppreference - I strongly suggest you to 
check them.
