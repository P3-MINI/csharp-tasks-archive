The whole task is about creating Matrix class.

Stage_1 (1.5 Pts)

Create two public int automatic properties: Rows and Cols.
Create a private field of rectangular array values.
Create a construcor with three parameters: int rows, int cols, values (rectangular array), where default value of "values" is null. The constructor should allocate memory for values and make a deep copy of a corresponding parameter.
Create a public property Trace with only "get" accessor. It should return a sum of values[i,i].
Create void Print() method to print matrix. Use `Console.Write("{0, 4}   ", values[i, j]);`

Stage_2 (1 Pts)

Create an explicit conversion from matrix to double[,].
Create an implicit conversion from double[,] to matrix.

Stage_3 (1 Pts)

Create operator+, which takes two matrices and return a matrix as a result. A result matrix shoud have maximum of both dimensions, and when elements from input matrix are finished (we are out of bounds), we should "wrap" it (start from the beginning).

Create operator[] (get and set), where there are to integer parameters: rows (first) and columns (second).

Stage_4 (1.5 Pts)

Implement operator== and all operators and methods which should accompany this operator.
