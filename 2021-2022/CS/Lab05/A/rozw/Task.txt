Stage1 (3 points)
Create abstract class Item and two child classes: Magazine, Book.

Item class
Each Item has unique consecutive id which is assigned in a constructor and can't be changed.
Each Item has also three readonly fields which can be accessed from child classes but not from outside:
    author of type string,
    name of type string,
    printDate of type DateTime.
Class Item also has an abstract method CalculateFee which returns decimal and takes parameter of type int indicating the number of days.
In class Item there should also be methods GetId(), GetAuthor(), GetName(), GetPrintDate(),
which should return object id, author, name, and printDate respectively.
Each item has an overriden method ToString which returns text:
"Item with id: id"

Magazine class
Magazine class constructor has also a parameter of type int which indicates editionNumber.
Calculate fee method should return the number of days divided by 2 and multiplied by 10.
ToString method should return following string:
    ToString() from base class + "Magazine name by author, printed printDate edition: editionNumber"
 
Book class
Book class constructor has 2 more parameters than a Item class constructor, it also has a parameter of type decimal which specifies 
feePerDay value and a parameter of type bool which specifies if the book has hardcover and has a default value of false.
Calculate fee method should return following value:
    if days < 30 : days multiplied by feePerDay,
    if days >= 30 : 30 multiplied by feePerDay and double that for every day over 30 days.
ToString method should return following string:
    ToString() from base class + "Book name by author, printed printDate " + if book has hardcover "hardcover" else "softcover"
There should be also method HasHardcover() which returns true if book has hardcover and false if not.

Stage2 (1 point)
Create Bookshelf class.
It should have constructor which takes parameter specifying size of items array.
It should have method AddItem which has a parameter of type Item and adds it the array and returns true,
    if array is full the method should return false and do nothing else.
Create method GetItemsCount() which should return the number of items in the array.
Method Print() which returns void and prints on the console following text (example in output.txt):
     "Bookshelf with NumberOfItemsInArray
     Items:"
     for each item
        item.ToString() + new line
        
Stage3 (1 point)
Create Library class.
Add constructor which has two parameters, the first one is of type string and specifies the name of library,
    the second one is an array of Bookshelves (Bookshelf[]) which should be stored within object.
Implement GetItemsCount() method which returns the total number of items on all of the bookshelves in the array.
Method GetBookshelf(int i) should return Bookshelf number i from the array, i is out of bounds return null.
Method Print() should return void and print following text (example in output.txt):
    "Library name
    Shelves
    for each bookshelf
        "shelf i" (i is the number of the shelf
        invoke shelf.Print()
