Create abstract class Item and two child classes: Mail, Package.

Item class
Each Item has unique consecutive id which is assigned in a constructor and can't be changed.
Each Item has also three readonly fields which can be accessed from child classes but not from outside:
    sender of type string,
    recipient of type string,
    postageDate of type DateTime.
Class Item also has an abstract method CalculateArrivalTime() which returns DateTime.
In class Item there should also be methods GetId(), GetSender(), GetRecipient(), GetPostageDate(),
which should return object id, sender, recipient, and postageDate respectively.
Each item has an overriden method ToString which returns text:
"Item with id: id
 From: sender
 To: recipient
 Postage date: postageDate"

Package class
Package class constructor has also a parameter of type float which indicates weight.
CalculateArrivalTime method should return the postageDate + 15 days if weight > 20 and postageDate + 10 days otherwise.
ToString method should return following string:
    ToString() from base class + "Type: package" + new line + "Weight: weight"
There should be method GetWeight() which returns weight of the package.
 
Mail class
Book class constructor has 1 more parameter than a Item class constructor, it has a parameter of type bool which specifies
 if the mail is registered and has a default value of false.
CalculateArrivalTime method should return following value:
    if registered : postageDate + 2 days,
    if not : postageDate + 5 days
ToString method should return following string:
    ToString() from base class + "Type: " + (if mail is registered "registered" else "standard") + " mail"
There should be also method IsRegistered() which returns true if mail is registered and false if not.

Hint: to calculate arrival time you can use method AddDays.

Create PostBox class.
It should have constructor which takes 2 parameters first of type string specifying location, and the second one of type int specifying size of items array.
Create method GetItemsCount() which should return the number of items in the array (which are not null).
Create method GetItem(int i) return item at the position i, if i is out of bounds it should return null.
Method Print() which returns void and prints on the console following text (example in output.txt):
     "Postbox location
     Items:"
     for each item
        item i: item.ToString() + new line, i is the localization of the item in the array

Stage3 (1 point)
Create PostOffice class.
Add constructor which has one parameter which is an array of post boxes (PostBox[]) which should be stored within object.
Implement GetPostBoxesCount() method which returns the total number of post boxes in the array.
It should have method AddPostBox which has a parameter of type PostBox and adds it the array and returns true,
    if array is full the method should return false and do nothing else.
Method Print() should return void and print following text (example in output.txt):
    "Post office with (number of post boxes) post boxes  
    Post boxes:
    for each post box
        " i" (i is the number of the postbox)
        invoke shelf.Print()
