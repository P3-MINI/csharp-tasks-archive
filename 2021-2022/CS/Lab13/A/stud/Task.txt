Your task is to create the library class that represents information about books and their authors.
    The library holds this data both in memory as lists and saved in files on your disk.
Remember to change 'Copy to Output Directory' property of Books.csv file to 'Copy always'.

Stage_1 (1.5 Pts)
    The 'Library' class should contain two lists, for books and artists respectively.
        Additionally, a property that represents current path on disk - for further usages.

    Implement the constructor that creates empty catalog on disk, based on given string value.

    Implement static method Create(string libraryPath, string sourceFile) that creates new Library in location given by libraryPath (call the constructor here), based on csv source file located in sourceFile.
        As the library creation, you should add all books and authors to appropriate lists in library class. You should return newly created library.
        The order of fields in csv file is as follows: BookID, Title, CoverType, AuthorID, Name, Surname, Birthday, PublicationDate, PublicationLocation, Publisher.

    Implement Info() method that prints to console information about books. According to given output. Use already defined ToString methods.

Stage_2 (1.5 Pts)
    Create 'PathAlreadyExistsException' class that represents an exception thrown when given file or catalog already exists.

    In 'Library' class implement Add method. Method should be suitable for both books and authors. It should serialize the content to json file.
        Use the ID value as the filename. Throw an exception when given file already exists.
        Remember about special attributes for classes that you're serialising. Try not to repeat the code.
        Every ID field should be serialized using GUID name. Rememer to change the implementation of Create method to use newly created Add method.
        Add method should now add elements to appropriate lists. Add method in roder to be generic may use GetType method.

Stage_3 (1.0 Pts)
    Implement Get method, that takes in title of a book that we want to retrive.
        In order to do so, iterate over all files inside library's directory, deserialize them one by one and return if titles match.
        If there's no such book, return null. Remember that there are books and authors together, stored in single catalog.

    Implement Delete method, that takes in ID and deletes file with appropriate name.
        Throw an exception when file does not exists, and return true when the file has been successfully deleted.

Stage_4 (1.0 Pts)
    Implement Save(string filenamePath) method that serialises all books using xml serialization in location given by filenamePath.
        Remember about special attributes for our classes that we're serialising.
