Stage 1. (2.5 points)

Create generic interface IFormula with two methods: Calculate, which returns double and takes generic parameter x, and PrintFormula, which takes no parameters and returns string.
Create two classes that implement IFormula interface: QuadraticFormula, and ArithmeticSequenceSumFormula.

QuadraticFormula should have public properties that correspond to A, B and C (Ax^2+Bx+C), alongside with constructor that takes those parameters and sets them.
ArithmeticSequenceSumFormula should have public properties that are A1 and D (sum of n: n*(A1+a_n)/2), alongside with constructor that takes those parameters and sets them.

Both classes should implement the methods from interface & do it correctly. Since calculation for quadratic formula can be any real number, it should take it as parameter; in case of arithmetic sequence, only natural numbers should be allowed. You should use generic method from interface to achieve that.

Stage 2. (0.5 point)
Create extension method for class QuadraticFormula that will calculate derivative of the function in point x.

Stage 3. (2 points)
Create generic class FibonnaciGenerator, that implements interface IEnumerable. The constructor should take as the input an object of generic interface IFormula and store it within readonly property (without set option).

Implementation of GetEnumerator should use yield returns, and should use the Calculate method from the formula provided with the constructor on the subsequent fibonnaci number.
