Stage 1. - 1 point
Files: Program.cs
 
a) In Main function use lambda expression to sort persons array their absolute Age.
    You can only write code inside brackets persons.Sort(...); expression.
   
b) In Main function use lambda expression to print info about persons and sum their age using following criteria:
    if age is greater than 100 print "REDACTED!",
    else: add age of a person to the result.
    Result should be stored in "accumulatedAge" variable.
    You can only write code inside brackets of persons.ForEach(...); expression.
   
Stage 2. - 1.5 point
Files: Functions.cs
Class: BaseFunctions

You are not allowed to use lambda expressions here, you have to use delegates

a) Add public static method ConstantFunction which takes parameter of type double "d", and returns function which takes one parameter of type double "x" and returns value of "d". 

b) Add public static method ModulusFunction which takes two parameters of type double "a", "b" and returns function which takes one parameter of type double "x" and returns
    modulus of value of linear formula: ax + b
    
c) Add public static method PolynomialFunction which takes variable number of parameters (params keyword) of type double "tab" and returns function which takes one parameter of type double "x" 
    and computes the value of polynomial at point "x". "tab" parameter specifies coefficients of the polynomial, tab[0] is a coefficient next to "x" to the highest power.    
    Use Horner's method.
    
Stage 3. - 1 point
Files: Functions.cs
Class: FunctionsManipulator

You have to use lambda expressions here.

a) Add public static method ChooseFunction which takes two parameters f and g which are functions that take and return one parameter of type double each, method should return
    function that takes one parameter of type double "x" and if the fractional part of "x" is greater than 0.5 it returns value of f at "x" otherwise it returns value of g at "x". 

b) Add public static method MultiplyFunctions which takes two parameters f and g which are functions that take and return one parameter of type double each, method should return
    function that takes one parameter of type double "x" and returns the multiplication value of the difference of the f,g at "x".
    
c) Add public static method CombineFunctions which takes two parameters f and g which are functions that take and return one parameter of type double each, method should return
    function that takes one parameter of type double "x" and returns function composition (f ∘ g) of the f,g at "x".

Stage 4. - 1 point
Files: Functions.cs, Program.cs
Class: ExtensionMethods

In Function.cs:

a) Add extension method PerformAction to the IEnumerable<Person> interface which takes one parameter which specifies an action to perform on each element of the collection
    and takes two parameters, Person to perform action on, and int number - place of an object in collection.
    Method should perform that action on every element of the collection. Return type is void.
    
b) Add extension method Accumulate to the IEnumerable<Person> interface which takes two parameters, 
    first is "accumulateFunc" which is a function that takes two parameters: object of type Person and current sum and returns one parameter of type double.
    Method should return a double which is return value of last invocation of "accumulateFunc", in each new invocation use current sum.
    
In Program.cs:

a) Write action which modifies age property of Person if its number (i) in collection is divisible by 3, Write: i+"Age changed!" or i+"No changes made" correspondingly.
    Action should be passed to "persons.PerformAction(...)" expression.
b) Write function which sums age of all persons in array, use starting value of 0.
    Function should be passed to "persons.Accumulate(...)" expression.
