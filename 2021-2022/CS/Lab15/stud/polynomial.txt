There is an interface:

interface IComputable<T>
    {
    T Add(T x);
    T Sub(T x);
    T Mul(T x);
    T Div(T x);
    }

   Define value type Real:
   - it contains (in private field) a value of type double
   - it implements the interface IComputable<Real>
   - it makes possible implicit conversions: Real -> double  i  double -> Real

2) (3.5 pkt)
   Define generic type Polynomial<T>,
      where T must be a value type which implements the interface IComputable<T>
   implement operations:
   - a constructor with int parameter - a degree of the polynomial (it means a number of coefficients is greater by one, all of them are equal zero)
   - a constructor with parameter T[] - an array of coefficients (it means a degree is smaller by one)
   - a property Degree - degree (just to obtain a value)
   - adding of polynomials (operator)
   - multiplying of polynomials (operator)
   - negation of polynomial (operator "unary minus") - a change of sign of all coefficients
   - indexing (argument of type int, we assume it never is negative)
     reading
	    for index <= degree it returns corresponding coefficient
		for index >  degree it returns zero
	 assigning
	    for index <= degree it modify corresponding coefficient
		for index >  degree it creates a new array of coefficients so a degree == argument,
		              where it assigns a given value at the index position (the rest is copied, lacking are filled with zero)
   - it is possible to use a foreach construction (reading coefficients from 0 to the last)
   - ToString() method - examples of output in main
   - Polynomial<T> Clone() method - creates a new polynomial with the same coefficients

   - indexing                -  1.0

   - define a generic method Neg<T> which extends a type T by a negation (changing a sign of a value)
     of a value assuming that the T implements the interface IComputable<T>
   - define a generic method Horner<T> which extends a type Polynomial<T> by calculating a value
     of polynomial in a given point (you can ask about a Horner schema your teacher)
