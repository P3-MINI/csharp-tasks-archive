// Difference between struct and classes
// inheritance example (virtual, override, new)
// private, internal, public, protected
// static i nonstatic field and methods (when to use static)
// constructor and destructor (what is going on when we create object from bottom of hierarchy)

// Better: multiple constructors calling eachother 
// sealed - can't inherit

// simple task to create inheritance based on the presentation
