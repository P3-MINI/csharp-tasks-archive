Before starting the task, read the entire text below!!!

The aim of the task is to write 5 queries (using LINQ technology) to a simple database for an online store.
Queries can be performed in any order. The exact contents of the tasks and what needs to be done are placed in 
the Program.cs file, and there the solution should be placed along with printing it to the console.

Queries MUST be implemented using LINQ technology. It is NOT ALLOWED to process collections that are part of 
the database "manually," e.g., using for, foreach, and similar instructions.

Queries 1-4 should be implemented as single query expressions or as a single chain query.
Task 5 can be implemented as several related expressions or queries (as single expressions, of course, you can too).

In the Database.cs file, there are records representing tables in the database (Book, Author, BookAuthor, Member, Loan),
while in the Database class, there are lists with data representing the above-mentioned tables.

The Book table stores a list of all books available in the library; it contains such data as:
Book ID (BookId), title (Title), and the year of the publication (PublicationYear).

The Author table stores a list of the book's authors; it contains such data as:
Author ID (AuthorId), first name (FirstName), and last name (LastName).

The BookAuthor table stores the connection information between books and their authors; it contains two fields:
Book ID (BookId) and Author ID (AuthorId).

The Member table stores a list of all library members; it contains such data as:
Member ID (MemberId), first name (FirstName), last name (LastName), and their registration date (RegistrationDate).

The Loan table stores a list of all member's loans information; it connection such data as:
Loan ID (LoanId), member ID (MemberId), book ID (BookId), loan date (LoanDate), 
and optionally if the book was already returned, its date (ReturnDate).
