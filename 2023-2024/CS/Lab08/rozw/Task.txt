Lab08: Interfaces and yield

NOTE: Do not use LINQ in this task!

Part 1. (1.5 points)
In file Sequences.cs, add ISequence interface, which implements IEnumerable, and has one read-only property Name.
Create the following classes which implement ISequence interface:

a) RandomSequence - sequence returns random integer values from a given range [a, b).
   You should also provide an optional parameter for seed. Use the Random class and initialize it with the given seed,
   if provided.
   Name property returns "Random Sequence (range = [a, b), seed=x)".

b) GeometricSequence - geometric sequence based on a and q values.
   Name property returns "Geometric Sequence (a = {}, q = {})".

c) TribonacciSequence - tribonacci sequence, T_0 = 0, T_1 = 0, T_2 = 1, T_n = T_n-3 + T_n-2 + T_n-1 for n >= 3
   Name property returns "Tribonacci Sequence".

Part 2. (1.5 points)
In file Functions.cs, create an IFunction interface defining one method: Evaluate(). Evaluate takes a double
and returns a double. Implement the given function using IFunction interface:
a) QuadraticFunction - implements the quadratic function. Constructor as arguments take a, b, and c coefficients.
b) SinFunction - implements sinus function. Use Sin from the Math library.
c) HalfCircleFunction - implement a function that is the top half of the unit circle (r=1) with a center in
    the origin of the coordinate system (0,0).

Add a new sequence FunctionalSequence, which uses the IFunction interface. The constructor arguments are:
a function, start value, step, and name and returns a series of values evaluated in points starting in the start value
and increased by step.

Part 3. (2 points)
In Integrator.cs file, add to IIntegral interface with Solve method, which takes some range and returns interface for
the enumerator.
Implement classes:
a) NumericalIntegrator - numerical integration using the rectangle method (you can evaluate the value on the left side
    of the bar). Pass a function to integrate in the constructor. Start returning values with two divisions and double
    it with every iteration.
    For more details, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration
b) MonteCarloIntegrator - integration using Monte Carlo method. It randomizes some points on a rectangular area where
    we want to calculate an integral and check if the given points are above or below the function. The result
    (integral value) is proportional to the number of points below and the total number of samples multiplied by area.
    Pass a number of samples per iteration in the constructor and increase it by this value with each iteration.
    Assume that y is in a range from 0 to maxY (constructor parameter).
