WARNING: In order to create a new class/method parameter variable, use the INumber interface (.Net 7.0+)!

Stage_1 (1.0 Point)
	* Create a generic Grade structure that constrains its generic type to the INumber<> interface.
		* It contains of T Value property, appropriate constructor and implicit cast operator from Grade<T> to T.
	* Create three structures (Presence, Quiz, Task) containing a property of type Grade<> with int, float, float types respectively. Property should have a name Grade.
	* Create a Laboratory structure with three public properties of types given by structures created above (Presence, Quiz, Task).
		* Create constructor.
		* Quiz should be an optional (nullable).
	* Create a SubjectInfo class with a public (read-only) property representing a dictionary (storing KeyValuePairs in chronological order), the key should be DateTime and the value Laboratory.
		The class contains three generalized methods named (GetPresences, GetQuizzes, GetTasks) that return lists of types implementing the INumber<> interface.
		These methods return a list of values from the dictionary representing presence, quizzes, and tasks respectively.

Stage_2 (1.0 Point)
	* Create a generic IWeights interface that implements a generic IEnumerable interface, constraining the generic parameter to the variation of the INumber<> interface.
	* Create two classes implementing the IWeights interface that generate weights in the following way:
		* Generic UniformWeights class that returns a constant weight value equals to 1.
		* Generic RandomWeights class that returns random weights in the Start-End range (both are T type), using given Seed. The range and seed are given in the constructor.
			* Range is given as a T type argument, whereas seed can be null (in that case, use parameterless constructor for Random).
			* Use Random to generate a random double, scale it to match the range and convert it to the T type.
				NOTE: Keep in mind that every time you call GetEnumerator, we want to get the same sequence of random values.

Stage_3 (1.0 Point)
	* Create a static StringExtension class.
		* Create static Random method that takes a string representing available characters, an int representing a seed (default value is 12345) and int indicating the length of the generated string (default value is 10).
			* This method returns a random string of characters of a given length. Use StringBuilder for better performance.
		* Create an extension method for string called Rot18. The method returns a new string rotated by 18 (13 for letters and 5 for numbers). Leave the other characters intact.
			NOTE: Performing Rot18 twice on a string gets it back to its original form. Hint: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13

Stage_4 (1.0 Point)
	* Create two extension methods for the generic IEnumerable<> interface, where we constrain the generic parameter to the appropriate variation of the INumber<> interface.
		* Generic Mean method that calculates the mean of numbers in the generic IEnumerable<> collection. The method takes an additional argument of generic IWeights<>.
			NOTE: Collection values and weights have different types (but both of them implement INumber<> interface). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean
		* Generic StandardDeviation method that calculates standard deviation of numbers in the generic IEnumerable<> collection. The method takes an additional argument of generic IWeights<>.
			NOTE: Collection values and weights have different types (but both of them implement INumber<> interface). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation

Stage_5 (1.0 Point)
	* Create another extension method for IEnumerable<>.
		* Generic method MovingAverage that return a sequence of averages based on values in the collection. Provide a parameter describing the period (default value is 3).
